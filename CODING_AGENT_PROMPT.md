## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards
- **Python**: Use `uv` for dependencies, type hints, 88-char lines, Google docstrings
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode, no `any`, interfaces over types, ES modules
- **Rust**: Ownership patterns, `Result<T,E>` + `?`, async tokio
- **Go**: Simple code, explicit errors, small interfaces, table tests
- **Nushell**: `def "namespace command"`, type hints, structured data pipelines

### Integration Patterns
1. **Leverage Existing Systems**: Always build upon existing infrastructure rather than recreating
2. **MCP Tool Integration**: Use existing 64+ MCP tools for environment operations
3. **DevPod Swarm**: Utilize centralized management for environment provisioning
4. **Enhanced Hooks**: Integrate with existing AI automation for real-time optimization
