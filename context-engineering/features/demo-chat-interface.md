# Feature: Interactive Chat Interface with Agent Integration

## FEATURE:
Build a modern chat interface component that integrates with CopilotKit for agent-based conversations. The interface should support real-time messaging, typing indicators, message history, and dynamic UI generation based on agent responses. Include support for tool-based interactions and collaborative state management.

Key requirements:
- TypeScript/React implementation with strict type safety
- CopilotKit integration for agent communication
- Real-time chat with streaming responses
- Dynamic UI components generated by agents
- Shared state management between user and agent
- Responsive design with dark/light theme support
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1)
- Comprehensive testing with Jest and React Testing Library

## EXAMPLES:
- Use patterns from `context-engineering/examples/dojo/agentic_chat` for chat interface structure
- Reference `context-engineering/examples/dojo/agentic_generative_ui` for dynamic UI generation
- Apply `context-engineering/examples/dojo/shared_state` patterns for collaborative features
- Follow TypeScript patterns from `typescript-env/src/` for type safety
- Use component patterns from `context-engineering/examples/dojo/src/components/ui/` for UI consistency
