# PRP Execution Reports

This directory contains execution reports generated by the `/execute-prp` command.

## Report Format

Each report includes:
- **Execution Summary**: Tasks executed, validation results, timing
- **Performance Metrics**: Resource usage and timing data (if monitoring enabled)
- **Validation Results**: Success/failure status for each validation gate
- **Error Details**: Detailed information about any failures

## Report Naming

Reports are named with the pattern: `{prp-name}-{timestamp}.md`

Example: `user-api-python-20241207-143022.md`

## Usage

Reports are automatically generated when running:
```bash
/execute-prp path/to/prp.md --validate --monitor
```

## Retention

- Reports are kept for reference and debugging
- Old reports can be cleaned up manually as needed
- Consider archiving reports older than 30 days
