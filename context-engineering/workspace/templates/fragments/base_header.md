**Core Principles**
1. **Context is King**: Include ALL necessary documentation, examples, and caveats
2. **Validation Loops**: Provide executable tests/lints the AI can run and fix
3. **Information Dense**: Use keywords and patterns from the polyglot codebase
4. **Progressive Success**: Start simple, validate, then enhance
5. **Environment Awareness**: Consider devbox, cross-language integration
6. **Global Rules**: Follow all rules in CLAUDE.md and environment-specific conventions
