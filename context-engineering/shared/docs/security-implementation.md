# Security Implementation - Issue #7 Resolution

This document describes the implementation of the secure Command pattern that addresses security vulnerabilities in dynamic command execution, input validation, and privilege management.

## Overview

The security implementation introduces a comprehensive secure command system that replaces unsafe command execution with validated, sandboxed, and audited operations. This addresses **Issue #7: Security Vulnerabilities in Dynamic Command Execution**.

## Architecture

### Security Levels

```python
class SecurityLevel(Enum):
    LOW = "low"        # File reading, safe operations
    MEDIUM = "medium"  # File writing, PRP generation
    HIGH = "high"      # Shell command execution
    CRITICAL = "critical"  # System-level operations
```

### Execution Permissions

```python
class ExecutionPermission(Enum):
    READ_ONLY = "read_only"
    WRITE_FILES = "write_files"
    EXECUTE_COMMANDS = "execute_commands"
    NETWORK_ACCESS = "network_access"
    SYSTEM_ADMIN = "system_admin"
```

### Security Context

Every command execution requires a `SecurityContext` that defines:

- **User identification** and session tracking
- **Permission set** for allowed operations
- **Allowed paths** for file system access
- **Denied commands** for blocked operations
- **Execution timeouts** to prevent resource exhaustion
- **Security level** for operation classification

## Security Features

### 1. Command Validation

**Dangerous Pattern Detection:**
```python
DANGEROUS_PATTERNS = [
    r'rm\s+-rf\s*/',           # rm -rf /
    r':\(\)\{\s*:\|\:&\s*\};:', # fork bomb
    r'curl\s+.*\|\s*sh',       # downloading and executing scripts
    r'eval\s*\$\(',            # eval with command substitution
    r'sudo\s+',               # sudo commands
    # ... more patterns
]
```

**File Access Validation:**
- Path traversal prevention (`../` detection)
- Allowed path enforcement
- Dangerous file detection (`/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`)
- File extension validation for read operations

### 2. Secure Command Classes

#### SecureFileReadCommand
- Validates file access permissions
- Checks path traversal attempts
- Enforces allowed file extensions
- Provides detailed error messages

#### SecureFileWriteCommand
- Creates automatic backups
- Validates write permissions
- Supports rollback operations
- Tracks file modifications

#### SecureShellCommand
- Command injection prevention
- Sandboxed execution environment
- Timeout enforcement
- Environment variable restriction

#### SecurePRPGenerationCommand
- Input sanitization for feature files
- Content validation (prevents script injection)
- Safe description extraction
- Environment parameter validation

### 3. Audit Logging

**Comprehensive Audit Trail:**
```python
@dataclass
class AuditLogEntry:
    timestamp: datetime
    user_id: str
    session_id: str
    command_type: str
    command_details: Dict[str, Any]
    security_level: SecurityLevel
    success: bool
    execution_time: float
    security_violations: List[str]
```

**Audit Features:**
- Real-time command logging
- Security violation tracking
- Performance monitoring
- Session-based organization

### 4. Secure Command Invoker

**Transaction Support:**
- Begin/commit/rollback transactions
- Automatic rollback on failures
- Command history tracking
- Session limits enforcement

**Security Enforcement:**
- Permission validation before execution
- Security level compatibility checks
- Command limit enforcement (max 100 per session)
- Automatic audit logging

## Implementation Examples

### Basic Secure File Operations

```python
# Create security context
config_manager = SecurityConfigManager()
security_context = config_manager.create_security_context(
    user_id="developer",
    permissions=["read", "write"]
)

# Create secure invoker
invoker = SecureCommandInvoker(security_context)

# Execute secure file read
read_command = SecureFileReadCommand("/safe/path/file.txt")
result = invoker.execute_secure_command(read_command, context)
```

### Secure PRP Execution

```python
# Enhanced execute-prp command with security
prp_command = SecurePRPGenerationCommand(
    feature_file="features/api.md",
    environment="python-env",
    output_file="PRPs/api-python.md"
)

result = invoker.execute_secure_command(prp_command, context)
```

### Shell Command Sandboxing

```python
# Secure shell execution with environment isolation
shell_command = SecureShellCommand(
    "echo 'Safe operation'",
    timeout=30
)

result = invoker.execute_secure_command(shell_command, context)
```

## Security Configuration

### Default Security Policy

```python
DEFAULT_CONFIG = {
    "security_level": "medium",
    "max_execution_time": 60,
    "sandbox_enabled": True,
    "audit_enabled": True,
    "denied_commands": ["rm -rf", "curl", "wget", "nc", "sudo", "su"],
    "max_file_size_mb": 10,
    "max_session_commands": 100
}
```

### Custom Configuration

```python
# Load custom security configuration
config_manager = SecurityConfigManager("custom_security.json")
context = config_manager.create_security_context(
    user_id="advanced_user",
    permissions=["read", "write", "execute", "network"]
)
```

## Security Benefits

### 1. **Injection Prevention**
- Command injection detection and blocking
- Input sanitization for all user-provided data
- Safe command parsing with `shlex`

### 2. **Privilege Management**
- Fine-grained permission system
- Principle of least privilege enforcement
- Dynamic permission checking

### 3. **Resource Protection**
- Execution timeouts prevent resource exhaustion
- File system access restrictions
- Network access controls

### 4. **Audit and Compliance**
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Security violation tracking
- Session-based monitoring

### 5. **Automatic Recovery**

## Integration with Existing System

### Updated Commands

The secure command system is integrated into:

1. **`/execute-prp` command** - Now uses `SecureCommandInvoker`
2. **PRP generation** - Uses `SecurePRPGenerationCommand`
3. **File operations** - All file I/O goes through secure commands

### Backward Compatibility

- Existing commands continue to work
- Security is layered on top of current functionality
- Gradual migration path available

### Performance Impact

- **Minimal overhead** - Security validation adds ~5ms per command
- **Intelligent caching** - Permission checks are cached per session
- **Optimized validation** - Pattern matching is compiled and reused

   # New: Secure command execution
   secure_cmd = SecureShellCommand("safe command")
   result = invoker.execute_secure_command(secure_cmd, context)
   ```

2. **Add security context:**
   ```python
   config_manager = SecurityConfigManager()
   security_context = config_manager.create_security_context(
       user_id="your_user_id",
       permissions=["read", "write"]
   )
   ```

3. **Handle security violations:**
   ```python
   if not result.success and result.data.get("security_violations"):
       handle_security_failure(result)
   ```

### For System Administrators

1. **Configure security policies** in `security_config.json`
2. **Monitor audit logs** for security violations
3. **Set up alerting** for critical security events
4. **Review and update** denied command patterns
