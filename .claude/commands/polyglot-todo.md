## Smart Task Management

### Context-Aware Task Creation
- **File-based context**: Tasks inherit environment from current working directory
- **Language detection**: Automatically tag tasks with relevant language/environment
- **Dependency inference**: Detect cross-environment dependencies
- **Priority assignment**: Intelligent priority based on impact and urgency

### Cross-Environment Workflows
- **Feature development**: Track tasks across multiple environments for polyglot features
- **Migration tasks**: Coordinate updates across language boundaries
- **Integration testing**: Ensure comprehensive testing across environments
- **Deployment coordination**: Synchronize deployment-related tasks

## Instructions
1. **Environment Detection**:
   - Analyze current working directory and file context
   - Map tasks to appropriate environments
   - Identify cross-environment dependencies
   - Set intelligent priorities based on impact

2. **Task Creation with Context**:
   ```bash
   # Single environment task
   /polyglot-todo add "Implement user authentication endpoint" --env python-env --priority high
   
   # Cross-environment feature
   /polyglot-todo add "Add real-time notifications" --env python-env,typescript-env --priority medium
   
   # Infrastructure task
   /polyglot-todo add "Update CI/CD pipeline" --env nushell-env --priority low
   ```

3. **Integration with Existing System**:
   - Sync with TodoWrite/TodoRead for consistency
   - Maintain existing task IDs and structure
   - Enhance with environment and language context
   - Preserve priority and status information

4. **Intelligent Task Management**:
   - Detect task dependencies across environments
   - Suggest optimal task ordering for efficiency
   - Identify blocking tasks and critical path
   - Provide completion time estimates

5. **Progress Tracking**:
   - Monitor task completion across environments
   - Track performance metrics for task types
   - Generate productivity reports
   - Identify bottlenecks and improvement opportunities

6. **GitHub Integration**:
   - Link tasks to GitHub issues and PRs
   - Create issues for high-priority tasks
   - Track commit progress against tasks
   - Generate release notes from completed tasks
