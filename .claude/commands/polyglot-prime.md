## Context Loading Strategy

### Project Structure Analysis
- Repository root and environment organization
- Devbox configuration and package management
- Cross-language dependencies and integrations
- Automation scripts and workflow orchestration

### Environment-Specific Context
- **Python**: `pyproject.toml`, dependencies, virtual environment setup
- **TypeScript**: `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, Node.js configuration  
- **Rust**: `Cargo.toml`, workspace configuration, crate dependencies
- **Go**: `go.mod`, module structure, build configuration
- **Nushell**: Scripts, modules, automation workflows, configuration files

### Development Infrastructure
- Claude Code hooks and automation system
- Intelligence monitoring scripts and analytics
- Security scanning and secret management
- Performance monitoring and optimization tools
- GitHub integration and workflow automation

## Instructions
1. **Repository Structure Mapping**:
   - Read project root structure and organization
   - Identify all `*-env/` directories and their purposes
   - Understand `.claude/` configuration and hooks setup
   - Map cross-environment dependencies and workflows

2. **Configuration Analysis**:
   ```bash
   # Read all devbox configurations
   python-env/devbox.json, typescript-env/devbox.json, etc.
   
   # Language-specific configurations
   python-env/pyproject.toml
   typescript-env/package.json, tsconfig.json
   rust-env/Cargo.toml
   go-env/go.mod
   nushell-env/config.nu, common.nu
   ```

3. **CLAUDE.md Deep Analysis**:
   - Project overview and development principles
   - Environment setup and usage patterns
   - Automation and intelligence features
   - Development workflow and best practices
   - Integration points and dependencies

4. **Hooks and Automation Context**:
   - Read `.claude/polyglot-hooks-config.json`
   - Understand automation triggers and workflows
   - Map intelligence monitoring capabilities
   - Analyze security and performance tracking

5. **Intelligence Scripts Inventory**:
   ```bash
   nushell-env/scripts/performance-analytics.nu
   nushell-env/scripts/resource-monitor.nu  
   nushell-env/scripts/dependency-monitor.nu
   nushell-env/scripts/security-scanner.nu
   nushell-env/scripts/environment-drift.nu
   nushell-env/scripts/failure-pattern-learning.nu
   nushell-env/scripts/test-intelligence.nu
   ```

6. **Development State Assessment**:
   - Current git status and recent changes
   - Active development areas and focus
   - Performance baselines and metrics
   - Security posture and compliance status
   - Cross-environment consistency validation
